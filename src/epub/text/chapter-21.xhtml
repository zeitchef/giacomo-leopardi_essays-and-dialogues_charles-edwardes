						<td>How many years have gone by since you began to sell almanacs?</td>
					</tr>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Almanac Seller</td>
						<td>About twenty years, Sir.</td>

						<td>So they say.</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>

						<td>Ah, dear Sir, would to God I could!</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Almanac Seller</td>
						<td>I should not like that.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>

						<td>No, Sir, indeed I would not.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>
						<td>Then what life would you like?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Almanac Seller</td>
						<td>Such an one as God would give me without any conditions.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>
						<td>A life at haphazard, and of which you would know nothing beforehand, as you know nothing about the New Year?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Almanac Seller</td>
						<td>Exactly.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>
						<td>It is what I should wish, had I to live my life over again, and so would everyone. But this proves that Fate has treated us all badly. And it is clear that each person is of opinion that the evil he has experienced exceeds the good, if no one would wish to be reborn on condition of living his own life over again from the beginning, with just its same proportion of good and evil. This life, which is such a fine thing, is not the life we are acquainted with, but that of which we know nothing; it is not the past life, but the future. With the New Year Fate will commence treating you, and me, and everyone well, and the happy life will begin. Am I not right?</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Almanac Seller</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>
						<td>Show me the best almanac you have.</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Almanac Seller</td>
						<td>Here it is, Sir. This is worth thirty soldi.</td>
					</tr>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Passerby</td>
						<td>Here are thirty soldi.</td>
